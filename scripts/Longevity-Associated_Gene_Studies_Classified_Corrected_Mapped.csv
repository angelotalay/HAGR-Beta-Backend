This result corroborates our previous observations from heat shock response (HSR) study where we had shown that after heat stimulation, mononuclear cells from the carriers of genotype HSPA1L-TT had better HSR than cells with the HSPA1L-CC genotype.",20388092,"Positive","significant"
"HLA+AC0-DRB1","major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1","6p21.3","Sicilian","We have genotyped 77 centenarians and 299 healthy controls for HLA-DRB1 and 44 centenarians and 57 healthy controls for KIR receptors=HLA ligands, all from Palermo and surrounding municipalities in western Sicily, Italy.","results obtained show that only an HLA allele (DRB1*18) is associated with longevity. To confirm this association, a further study in a new cohort of centenarians and controls is needed. On the other hand, no significant association between successful aging and KIR gene content was observed in this Sicilian population.",20426625,"Positive","significant"
"CETP","cholesteryl ester transfer protein, plasma","16q13","Unknown","We examined the associations among CETP genotype, phenotype, and blood pressure in a cohort of 521 older adults (who have complete data for the variables required in our primary analysis) enrolled between November 1, 1998, and June 30, 2003, in our ongoing studies of genes associated with longevity, including a cohort with a high prevalence of a genotype coding for a reduced activity variant of CETP and low levels of CETP."," The prevalence of hypertension was actually lower among homozygotes for the variant CETP (48% vs 60% among those with wild-type and 65% among heterozygotes; P=.03). Low levels of CETP were associated with reduced prevalence of hypertension (65% in highest tertile, 59% in middle tertile, and 55% in lowest tertile; P=.04) and lower systolic blood pressure (140.8, 138.1, 136.2 mm Hg, respectively; P=.03). CONCLUSION: Reduced levels of CETP are associated with lower, not higher, blood pressure",20511482,"Negative","nonsignificant"
"CYP19","cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide 1","15q21","Cilento area in the district of Salerno, southern Italy","This investigation examines the association of ESR1 (PvuII and XbaI) and CYP19 (rs4646) polymorphisms with longevity. A sample of 258 individuals (mean age = 83.1 ﾱ 5.7 years) was recruited in 2000. Based on mortality data collected in 2009, the sample was divided into two groups of participants surviving more than 90 years or not.","The analysis showed that ESR1 PP (odds ratio = 2.2) and CYP19 genotypes carrying the T allele (odds ratio = 1.9) were significantly associated with longevity (survival to age more than 90 years). As the ESR1 PP genotypes were found associated with reduced fertility in the same sample, we may infer that ESR1 genotypes could exert an antagonistic pleiotropic effect on longevity and fertility.",20819792,"Positive","significant"
